# SQL-COVID19-EDA
COVID-19 Exploratory Data Analysis in SQL

This project analyzes global COVID-19 data using SQL to uncover meaningful insights. The analysis aims to explore trends, relationships, and patterns in the pandemic's spread, mortality, and vaccination efforts across countries and continents. Key tasks include:

1. Calculating the Total Deaths as a percentage of Total Cases for each country to measure case fatality rates.

2. Determining the Total Cases as a population percentage for a better understanding of infection spread within countries.

3. Identifying Countries with the Highest Infection Rates compared to Population to highlight regions most affected by COVID-19.

4. Highlighting Countries with the Highest Death Count per Population to assess the pandemic's impact on mortality rates.

5. Analyzing Continents with the Highest Death Count per Population to uncover regional trends in fatalities.

6. Exploring the relationship between Vaccination Rates and Population to understand how vaccination efforts correlate with overall population sizes.
